# From now on we define and create our ressources

# The resource group is already created by Delegate, 
# but if we wanted to create it from scratch, we would do something like this

#### Example of how to create a resource group via az cli:

# Write-Host "Deploying resource group" -ForegroundColor Yellow

# $output = az group create `
# --name 'rg_ramtin' `
# --location 'westeurope
# Throw-WhenError -output $output

# Note: use backticks ---> ` <---- to change line

## In your first az cli script, you need to create the following:
# - Function App
# - Storage Account
# - App Service Plan
# Please note that the order matters as the commands are run sequentially...

# You can find the documentation for the az cli commands here:
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest

# Prerequisite
# AZ CLI is installed
# When deploying the script with Powershell you need to enter the following command in order to be able to run the script: 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy  ByPass'
# When the script has run, then go to the portal and check inside your resource group, that the deployment has been successful.
